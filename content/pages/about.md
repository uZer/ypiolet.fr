French music producer and cloud architect living in Paris, born in 1990.

Dreaming of wires, static noise, glitching shapes on dusty CRT screens in
obscure warehouses, with heavy IDM music banging in the background.

Lifelong learner, modular synth addict, touchdesigner enthusiast.

Currently working at Radio France on cloud infrastructure and radio streaming
platform.
