French **audio+visual artist**, **producer** and **cloud native architect**
living in Paris, born in 1990.

Dreaming of wires, static noise signals, glitching shapes on dusty CRT screens
in obscure warehouses, with complex IDM music echoing on the concrete walls.

Lifelong learner, modular synth addict, audiovisual and photography enthusiast.

Feeling most at home in a `zsh` shell.

Currently working at **Radio France** on cloud infrastructure and radio
streaming platform.
